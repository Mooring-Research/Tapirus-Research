# Rota multi-species occupancy walkthrough

### ( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_OCO77_sc> ) Christian Anderson 5/24/2023

Read in detection/non-detection data

```{r}
#V1-V3 = weeks surveyed
#rows = cameras
bob <- read.csv('multiple species occupancy walkthrough/data/bobcat_3wk.csv', header = F)
coy <- read.csv('multiple species occupancy walkthrough/data/Coyote_3wk.csv', header = F)
fox <- read.csv('multiple species occupancy walkthrough/data/RedFox_3wk.csv', header = F)

head(fox, 10)



```

site level covariate data (covariates that only vary by site but stay constant for duration of survey)

-   Dist_5km = proportion disturbance within 5km

-   HDens_5km = housing density within 5km

-   latitude / longitude = latitude and longitude (div by 100)

-   People_site = total people recorded / 1000

-   trail = binary indicator of wheter camera was on trail (1) or not (0)

```{r}

occ_covs <- read.csv('data/psi_cov3wk.csv')
head(occ_covs)



```

read in detection level covariate on column for every repliacte survey; average temperature over one week replicate period (example of covariate that changes from detection to detection)

```{r}
det_covs <- read.csv('data/detection data.csv')
head(det_covs) 


```

apply unmarked package

```{r}

library(unmarked)


```

![](images/Screenshot%202023-05-24%20104331.png){width="430"}

place detection/non-detection into a named list

```{r}
#each element of list must be a matrix
y_list <- list(bobcat = as.matrix(bob),
               coyote = as.matrix(coy),
               redfox = as.matrix(fox))


```

Place detection covariates into a named list

```{r}
#each element of the list must be of the same dimension as each detection / non-detection mstrix
  #same num of rows (each site) and columns(repl survey)

det_list <- list(temp= det_covs)
  #temperature is a covariate that can change based on when there is a instance of detection 
  

```

combine data into an unmarkedFrameOccuMulti object:

```{r}
#fn+f1 pulls up help menu
msom_data <- unmarkedFrameOccuMulti(y = y_list, 
                                    siteCovs= occ_covs, 
                                    obsCovs = det_list)
    
```

### Intercept only model, assuming independence

#### Syntax similar to other models

-   need detection formula for each species

-   need occupancy formula for each natural parameter included in model (3)

-   need formulas (specified as character vector)

-   need order of formulas follows detection / non-detection list (bob, coy, fox

### Fit a Model

intercept only model that assumes independence among species. We do this by only allowing 1st order natural paramaters (maxOrder = 1) **assumes species occur independently at each site**

-   essentially the same as fitting three single species occupancy models

```{r}
fit_1 <- occuMulti(detformulas = c('~1', '~1', '~1'),
                   stateformulas = c('~1', '~1', '~1'),
                   maxOrder = 1,
                   data = msom_data)
            #state formulas len=3 so three natural parameters, i,e. three species
            #maxOrder = 1 makes it so that the model ignores natural params above              first order> assumes species occur independently at each site

```

This is equivalent to fitting 3 single-species occupancy models

```{r}
summary(fit_1)

```

### Intercept-only model, assuming dependence

-   set maxOrder = 2 to estimate up to 2nd order nat. params

-   permits dependence between species

-   fixes all nat params \> maxOrder at 0

```{r}
fit_2 <- occuMulti(detformulas = c('~1', '~1', '~1'),
                   stateformulas = c('~1', '~1', '~1',
                                     '~1', '~1', '~1'),
                   maxOrder = 2,
                   data = msom_data)
                #State Formulas> there are three choose two different possiblities,                   one for each combo
                #maxOrder = 2 sets natural parameters to 2nd order which allows for                   pairwise interactions between species 
                


```

#### Output interpretation

(Estimate = slope coefficient )

-   bobcat and coyote occur together more frequently than expected by chance (p\<0.01)

-   bobcat and red fox occur together less frequently than expected by chance (p\<0.01)

-   coyote and red fox occur together more frequently than expected by chance (p\<0.01)

-   AIC strongly favors the model incorporating dependence AIC= 6626.111 for fit_2 and AIC= 6710.658 for fit_1; it's much smaller

### Incorporating Covariates

-   any param can be modeled as a function of covariates

-   covariate models for each param can be unique

-   names of detection covariates correspond to names provided in named list

-   names of occupancy covariates correspond to names in data.frame

```{r}
fit_3 <- occuMulti(detformulas = c('~temp', '~1', '~1'),
                   stateformulas = c(  '~Dist_5km', '~HDens_5km', '~People_site',
                                     '~Latitude', '~1', '~1'),
                   maxOrder = 2, 
                   data = msom_data)
```

#### Sample interpretations:

-   for every I-unit increase disturbance within 5km, the log odds of bobcat occurance, when *coyote and red fox are absent,* declines by 22.96

-   When latitude = 0, bobcats are more likely to occur at a site when coyotes are present (and vice versa, p\<0.01)

-   For every I unit increase in Latitude, the log odds bobcats will occur at a site decreases by 18.98 if coyotes are also present, relative to equivalent sites where coyotes are absent

    -   *i.e., as we move north, bobcats and coyotes are less likely to occupy the same site*

-   For every I-unit increase in temperature, the log odds of bobcat detection decreases by 0.31

### Conditional occupancy probability

Calculation of conditional and marginal occupancy probabilities is done with predict function

-   create a data.frame for predictions

    -   the procedure is equivalent to creating data frames for all other applications of predict

-   Include complete range of observed latitude; hold all other variables at their mean

```{r}
nd_cond <- data.frame(
  Dist_5km = rep(mean(occ_covs$Dist_5km), 100), 
  HDens_5km = rep(mean(occ_covs$HDens_5km), 100), 
  People_site = rep(mean(occ_covs$People_site), 100), 
  Latitude = seq(min(occ_covs$Latitude), max(occ_covs$Latitude),
                 length.out = 100)
)
```

### Conditional occupancy probability

### Predicting bobcat occurance when coyotes are present

-   \<species\> indicates which species we assume when predicting occupancy

-   \<cond\> indicateswhich species we are assuming is present or absent

    ```{r}
    bob_coy_1 <- predict(fit_3, type = 'state' ,species = 'bobcat', 
                         cond = 'coyote', newdata = nd_cond)
      #what is the probability that a bobcat will be at a site on the condition that a coyote was present at that site
      
    ## Bootstrapping confidence intervals with 100 samples



    ```

#### Predicting bobcat occurrence when coyotes are absent

-   putting a - in front of coyote tells *predict* you wish to assume coyotes are absent

```{r}
bob_coy_0 <- predict(fit_3, type = 'state', species = 'bobcat', 
                     cond = '-coyote', newdata = nd_cond)
  #condition on coyote being absent

## Bootstrapping confidence intervals with 100 samples

```

#### Plotting

```{r}
gg_df_cond <- data.frame(
  latitude = rep(nd_cond$Latitude, 2), 
  occupancy = c(bob_coy_1$Predicted, 
                bob_coy_0$Predicted),
  low = c(bob_coy_1$lower,
          bob_coy_0$lower),
  high = c(bob_coy_1$upper,
           bob_coy_0$upper),
  conditional = rep(c('Coyote present', 'Coyote absent'),
                    each = 100)
)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

cond_fig <- ggplot(gg_df_cond, aes(x= latitude, y= occupancy, 
                                   group = conditional)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high, fill = conditional)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ylab('Conditional bobcat/noccupancy probability') +
  xlab('Latitude') + 
  labs(fill = 'Coyote state') + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25), 
        legend.position = c(0.75, 0.85))
```

#### Marginal occupancy probability

```{r}
nd_marg <- data.frame(
  Dist_5km = seq(min(occ_covs$Dist_5km), max(occ_covs$Dist_5km),
                 length.out = 100),
  HDens_5km = rep(mean(occ_covs$HDens_5km), 100), 
  People_site = rep(mean(occ_covs$People_site), 100), 
  Latitude = rep(mean(occ_covs$Latitude), 100)
)
```

omitting the conditional argument to calculate marginal occupancy probability

```{r}
bob_marg <- predict(fit_3, type = 'state', species = 'bobcat', 
                    newdata = nd_marg)

```

#### figure

```{r}
gg_df_marg <- data.frame(
  hd = nd_marg$Dist_5km, 
  occupancy = bob_marg$Predicted, 
  low = bob_marg$lower, 
  high = bob_marg$upper
  
)
```

```{r}
marg_fig <- ggplot(gg_df_marg, aes(x = hd, y= occupancy)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = low, ymax = high), alpha = .5) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Marginal bobcat\noccupancy probability') +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
```

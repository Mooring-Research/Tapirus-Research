	abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models {(GLM)} and linear mixed models.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models ({LMEMs)} have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using {LMEMs} for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that {LMEMs} generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of {LMEMs} including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only {LMEMs} used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal {LMEMs} should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type {II} errors as well.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. The advantages of LMMs over ANOVAs, however, come at a cost: Setting up an LMM is not as straightforward as running an ANOVA. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al., 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, models with a random effect structure that is supported by the data have optimal Type I error and power properties.},

	abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure. Recently, Barr et al. (2013) recommended fitting 'maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atypical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers’ knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

The explosion of research on {GLMMs} in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating {GLMM} parameters in simple cases, complex {GLMMs} are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

#Cate's Folder

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the organized conglomeration of the projects I worked on during Mooring's summer research 2023: scripts and plots for circadian activity, lunar phase activity, relative abundance index, occupancy model plots, and any extra files.

##**Circadian Activity** 
the folder containing my organized scripts and plots for circadian activity of the 4 tapir species.

**circ scripts**:

    *SingleCircPlots.R*: this script creates circadian activity plots for each tapir species using their solar data. Each plot that is created is separate and is only for one single species.

    *SingleCombinedCircPlots.R*: this script is like SingleCircPlots but it creates a circadian activity plot lattice of the four tapir species using their solar data (a lattice of the four single-species plots).

    *OverlapCircPlots.R*: this script creates circadian activity overlap plots, which compare each species to each other. The coefficient of overlap is calculated. The output are individual plots.

    *OverlapCombinedCircPlots.R*: this script is like OverlapCircPlots but creates a lattice of the overlap plots.

**circ plots**: folder containing my plots of circadian activity that were created using my circ scripts.

##**Relative Abundance Index** 
the folder containing my organized work, files, scripts, and graphs for the relative abundance index of the 4 tapir species. Any .**Rproj** files refer to my project I had in Rstudio.

    -   **RAI data**: folder containing the CSV file (**OrderedRAI1.csv**) that has the sites, calculated RAI values, and species of the tapir.

    -   **RAI scripts**: folder containing the script (**RAIggplot.R**) used to create a bar plot of RAI values in ggplot. 

    -   **RAI plots**: folder containing my .tif bar plots of RAI that were created using the RAIggplot script. 

        -   **regularRAIbarplot.tif**: this barplot is sized regularly (smaller axis text, larger plot)

        -   **smallRAIbarplot.tif**: this barplot was created to adjust its size for publication purposes (larger axis text, smaller plot).

    -   **rough drafts/extras - RAI**: folder containing all my extra random work, drafts, files, scripts, plots, etc for RAI. It is incomplete and less organized.

-   **Lunar Activity**: the folder containing my organized work, files, scripts, and plots for lunar activity of the 4 tapir species. Any .**Rproj** files refer to my project I had in Rstudio.

    -   **lunar data**: folder containing the raw datasets for each of the 4 tapir species (\*\*note that some of these datasets may not be subset for the correct species yet)

    -   **lunar scripts**: folder containing the scripts used to create lunar activity plots.

\> **Lunar.R**: script that takes raw datasets for each species, determines lunar phase data using getMoonIllumination, and produces plots for each species. Plots include: nocturnal or diurnal for each species (single-line), nocturnal+diurnal overlap for each species, nocturnal overlap between species, and combined/latticed plots.

\> **Plotsw/Lines.R**: script that incorporates vertical lines and percent values to divide the plot into sections based on lunar phase.

-   **lunar plots**: Baird's Nocturnal Lunar (example).png, Baird's Lunar Overlap (example).png, and Baird-Lowland Lunar Overlap (example).png are the plots that are produced using the Lunar.R script. BairdNocturnalw/Lines.png is the plot produced using the Plotsw/Lines.R script.

-   **rough drafts/extras - lunar**: folder containing all my extra random work, drafts, files, scripts, plots, etc for lunar activity. It is incomplete and less organized.

-   **Occupancy Plots**: folder containing scripts and plots for unicovariate occupancy models.

    -   **occu data**: folder containing all the datasets used to complete unicovariate occupancy modeling and plotting for each species. Each species has three datasets: occurrence, effort, covariates.

    -   **occu scripts**: folder containing the scripts used to create lunar activity plots.

\> **Cate_UniOccuPlots.R**: main script adapted from the other scripts in this folder. Contains the info needed to create unicovariate occupancy plots for each tapir species.

\> **BairdUnicovariateOccupancy.R**, **LowlandUnicovariateOccupancy.R**, **MalayanUnicovariateOccupancy.R**, **MountainUnicovariateOccupancy.R**: these scripts were developed by Christian and have the respective unicovariate occupancy models for each species.

\> **Graphics_All.R**: script from Sarah that is useful for making occupancy plots. Cate_UniOccuPlots.R is basically an updated version of this script, for our purposes.

-   **occu plots**: folder containing all the plots created using the Cate_UniOccuPlots.R script. These are for the top unicovariate models for each tapir species. It includes single plots, as well as plots combined/latticed together.

\

**Extras**: folder for extra files and scripts that I was trying out, these are incomplete and may not work

-   **Corrgram Script.R**: script to determine correlation between covariates and create correlogram plot

-   **MultiSpOccu(incomplete).R**: script where I was trying out multispecies occupancy, this was unsuccessful

-   **MyMalayanOccupancyModeling(incomplete).R**: trying out some occupancy modeling

-   **Single Species Graphs Individual and Latticed.R**: trying out density plots

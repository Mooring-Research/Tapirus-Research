## Convert Videos to To Images

These programs convert video files to jpg files to be used in WildID identification.
The code was copied from https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-opencv-video-to-still-image/ . 
The resultant images do not have the exif data necessary for wildID's metadata extraction, so they are unusable.

# Christian's folder
Christian's work consisted of updating the Baird's dataset, modeling for all the tapir species, deriving images from MP4, and extracting
sunTime for circadian activity. 

## Prefixes
**AM** = Lowland Tapir
**CR** = Baird's Tapir
**MA** = Malaysian Tapir
**MT** = Mountain Tapir

## Directory
*Recent Models* includes the most up-to-date models and their outputs. 
*random R scripts* includes some scripts that explore the techniques used
*Py scripts* has a few py scripts that make images from MP4 using the video's first frame.
*old model scripts* has several of the original scripts I built off of and fixed. The following iterations are in *Recent Models*.
*dataCleaningAndExtraction* has the scripts used to combine new records to the master dataset for CR.
*circadian scripts* shows how the suntime data was extracted

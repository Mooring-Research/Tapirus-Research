# Animal-research
This repository includes the scripts used to model the Tapir's occupancy and activity. The work has spanned several years and includes
much more analysis of many more genera than just Tapirus. 
Our research has built off of other's work, that being said, there is a lot of data that had been processed prior to our research. The 
resources specific to our work are found in the 'Cate', 'Christian', and 'data cleaning and model scripts' folders. Some of the methods we used ourselves, and many more we didn't, are found in 'Honors Projects.'

*Christian* most up-to-date Tapir modeling and circadian behaviour data cleaning.

*Cate* circadian, RAI, and lunar behaviour plotting

*data cleaning and model scripts* an assortment of old modeling scripts, data cleaning, and effort tabulation, and sunTime and 
temperature derivation and extraction.

*Honors Projects* past work and the source of original modeling scripts 

Script history can be traced backwards as follows: 'Christian/Recent models' > 'Christian/old model scripts' > 'data cleaning and model scripts' > 'Honors Projects'

We used the packages unmarked (version 1.2.5, https://rbchan.github.io/unmarked/) to run our occupancy models and determine the best one, and overlap package (version 0.3.4, https://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/personal/msr/overlap.html) to plot the temporal density plots. The data used for the circadian plots was calculated using the function elaborated in 'Christian
=======
We used the packages unmarked (to run our occupancy models and determine the best one) and overlap to make our circadian rythm figures. The heat maps use the top multicovariate model for each species; and there some exceptions due to correlations or choppy rasters (i.e. HFI). 
The data used for the circadian plots was calculated using the funtion elaborated in 'Christian.'

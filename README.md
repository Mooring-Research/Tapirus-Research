# Animal-research
This repository includes the scripts used to model the Tapir's occupancy and activity. The work has spanned several years and includes
much more analysis of many more genera than just Tapirus. 
Our research has built off of other's work, that being said, there is a lot of data that had been processed prior to our research. The 
resources specific to our work are found in the 'Cate', 'Christian', and 'data cleaning and model scripts' folders. Other methods that 
we did not use can be found in 'Honors Projects'. 

*Christian* most up-to-date Tapir modeling and circadian behaviour data cleaning.

*Cate* circadian, RAI, and lunar behaviour plotting

### Tools
We used the packages unmarked (to run our occupancy models and determine the best one) and overlap to make our circadian rythm figures.

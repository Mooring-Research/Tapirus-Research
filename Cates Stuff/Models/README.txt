## Unicovariate modeling for all Tapirus species

For each species, an unmarkedFitOccu (unmarked package) frame was created with detection, covariate, and effort tables for each species of Tapir for every covariate available for that tapir.
Some have more covariates than others, but the common ones include distance to road, NDVI, avgMaxTemp, avgMinTemp, Precipitation, and elevation. 

The outputs for these models are found in the unicovariateModselAll.txt file. 

# Multivariate files
All combinations of covariates are run against each other up to 5 together.
